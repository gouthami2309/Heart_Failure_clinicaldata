🚀 **Heart Failure Risk Prediction Using AI** 💡

I recently worked on a project leveraging **machine learning** to predict heart failure outcomes and cluster patients based on risk factors:

1. **Logistic Regression** for predicting heart failure outcomes.
   - Trained and evaluated the model on clinical data (age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine) to classify patient risk.
   
2. **K-Means Clustering** for segmenting patients into risk categories.
   - Applied K-Means clustering to identify patterns and group patients by risk, based on key clinical features.

🔍 **AI Impact:**  
This analysis enabled better patient risk stratification and informed decision-making for personalized treatment plans.
